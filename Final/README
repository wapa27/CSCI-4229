Controls
    esc        Exit Simulator
    'w/W'        Speed Up
    's/S'        Slow Down
    'b/B'        Fire Missle/Reset Missle
    't/T'        Takeoff (only works once you come to a complete stop)
    To land, come at the ground with a non-harsh angle

<!-- Some final comments -->
* I revamped the scene.
* There are two light sources, the moon and the missle. Missle should demonstrate
* functional normals. You'll see a lot of the vertices are down around the -2000
* mark along the y-axis; this isn't very clean looking and if I had a bit more time
* I'd go in and adjust the skybox and ground so that my base is 0. But I quickly
* got used to -2000 in development, so I'm sticking with it. Everything south of line
* 363 was done with no/minimal help or from a derivation of a class example. What I'm most proud
* of in the project is the landing/takeoff and missle. I'm pleased to have the lighting/normals working 
* correctly too.
